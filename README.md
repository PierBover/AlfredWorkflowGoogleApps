# Alfred Workflow for Google Apps
A simple workflow for accessing Google Apps.

![Icons](icons.jpg)

* `gmail` to open Gmail
* `docs` to open Google Docs
* `sheets` to open Google Sheets
* `calendar` to open Google Calendar
* `inbox` to open Google Inbox
* `slides` to open Google Slides
* `drive` to open Google Drive
* `photos` to open Google Photos
* `keep` to open Google Keep

In the future I plan to integrate more options (new doc, search, etc).

Note: You will have to deactivate Gmail and Drive from the default URL searches provided in Alfred to remove the duplicates.

To install simply download the [GoogleApps.alfredworkflow](GoogleApps.alfredworkflow?raw=true) file and double click to install on Alfred.
